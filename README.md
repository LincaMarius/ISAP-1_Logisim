This is the process of making the ISAP-1 computer at the simulation level using the Logisim program, which I went through.

# ISAP-1 Computer simulation in Logisim

The improved version of the SAP-1 computer.

This is the process of optimizing the functionality of the SAP-1 computer at the instruction set level, which I went through.

## About the project, brief description

The goal of this project is to create a more efficient version of the SAP (Simple As Possible) computer, but with minimal changes so that the instruction format remains the same.

This project is a continuation of other projects made by me:
https://github.com/LincaMarius/ISAP-Computer \
https://github.com/LincaMarius/ISAP-1_Computer_Instruction_Set

where we optimized the SAP-1 calculator at the block diagram level and at the instruction level.
I got four block diagrams:

The final block diagram of the CPU part of the system is:

The final block diagram of the Computer Memory system is:
